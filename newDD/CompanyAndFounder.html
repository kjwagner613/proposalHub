            <p>Discrete Development builds systems that stay true to their purpose — and evolve with the business
                without drifting from it.
                No drift. No decoration. Just structural integrity, anchored to original intent and loyal to business
                objectives.

            <p class="subCategory">Clarity in the foundation. Integrity in the structure. Systems that stay true to
                their purpose.</p>
            <p>
                Discrete Development builds systems with structural integrity — the kind that stay aligned with their
                purpose even as the world around them changes. We design workflows, automations, and ERP lite
                architectures that remain lean, stable, and predictable because they’re built with the end in mind and
                anchored to their foundation.</p>
            <p>
                Business objectives evolve. Priorities shift. A company today is not the same company it was five years
                ago — sometimes not even five months ago. Yet the infrastructure running beneath it was often designed
                for a different era, a different scale, a different incarnation of the business. Systems built for
                yesterday’s needs struggle to support today’s reality, and drift begins.
            </p>
            <p>Across decades of work in broadcast engineering and software, we’ve seen the same pattern: once a
                technology becomes established, it expands. A tool built to solve one problem grows to absorb every
                adjacent need. Over time, it drifts from its original purpose, becomes harder to maintain, and forces
                users to work around the system instead of through it. Not every technology follows this path, but the
                tendency is real.</p>
            <p>
                Our work exists to counter that drift. When complexity pulls a system off its foundation, we return to
                the beginning — to the purpose, the instruction, the objective function. A system’s job is simple:
                execute instruction reliably and predictably. Everything we build honors that responsibility.
            </p>
            <p>Whether the work lives inside Microsoft ecosystems or outside them, the philosophy stays constant:</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Purpose as intention. Structure as alignment. Implementation as expression.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>We build modular, walkable workflows that respect the truth of how data moves — with a quiet devotion to
                clarity, autonomy, and the structural integrity that keeps systems whole.</p>

            <p class="category">Founder Profile</p>
            <p class="subCategory">Kevin Wagner — Fouunder, Discrete Development</br>Systems Architect across
                mediums.
                Builder of modular, audit resistant workflows.</p>
            <p>My perspective was shaped 30 years ago in broadcast television — designing facilities, installing
                systems, and serving as an implementation engineer where failure wasn’t theoretical. In Burbank, when
                someone turned on their television, programming appeared every time. The product of countless teams,
                rooms, departments, and systems was a continuous, uninterrupted broadcast signal. It never went offline.
                In all those years, it never failed. It was not allowed to happen. That kind of pressure is almost
                unknown today. Back then, it was omnipresent.</p>

            <p>Those same principles guide my work now.</p>

            <p>I don’t build around vendors or frameworks.
                I build around the objective function — free of artificial constraints and platform loyalty.
            </p>
            <p>But if your world runs inside the Microsoft monoverses, I can work there too and still deliver the best,
                cleanest version of what you’re trying to achieve. </p>

            <p>Discrete Development exists to bring that philosophy into modern operations: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>ERP‑lite architectures </li>
                <li>map‑based workflows </li>
                <li>modular automations that are clear, resilient, and grounded in operational truth.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I don’t chase attention. I don’t chase hype.</p>
            <p>I build systems that work — across mediums, across decades, across industries.</p>

            <p class="category">Service Category 1: System Architecture & Initial Alignment</p>
            <p>Design and build systems that are anchored to purpose from day one — modular, walkable, and free of
                drift. Every workflow, automation, and ERP lite structure is built with clarity, structural integrity,
                and operational truth at its core.</p>
            <p class="category">Service Category 2: Ongoing Alignment Services</p>
            <p>As companies evolve, their systems often remain anchored to outdated priorities. We provide annual or bi
                annual system evolution reviews that identify drift, flag misalignment, and apply pre designed
                realignment plans. Each drift vector is anticipated in advance, with flexible architecture built into
                the original system so realignment is clean, predictable, and structurally sound.</p>
            <p>And while today’s alignment work is intentional and human guided, we’re already developing the next
                evolution of this discipline — a way to keep systems aligned continuously, without drift.</p>
            <p class="category">Positioning Statement</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We dont build one site fits all then scale down to maximize our profit.</li>
                <li>We build custom systems kept lean, efficient, resistent to drift by incorporating the needs of the
                    client.
                <li>We build for truth</li>
                <li>Out systems dont expand -- they stay aligned.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="category">ERP Lite Reference</p>
            <p>ERP Lite is a living demonstration of our methodology — lean, purpose anchored, and free of drift. It
                exists to show what happens when a system is built with clarity, intention, and structural integrity
                from the start.</p>
