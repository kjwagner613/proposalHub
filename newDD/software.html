                Purpose</p>
            <p>There is tremendous functionality in business software systems. Most try to make a version with every
                known requirement a client could request. Then trim it down for a prospective client when they are
                interested.</p>
            <p>To serve and support all the potential, it requires a massive framework. routes, functions, so much extra
                code that will not be used, and not needed for most businesses. They give you a list of available
                modules
                and functions contained in the business represented by those modules. The client only needs to point
                them out.
            </p>
            <p>I see constraint in that approach. Providing a set defines a boundary. It is your system, it should do
                what you need it to, what you want it to. Technological advancement, modernization, does not have to be
                restrictive. We don't take shortcuts. Lets make it freeing.</p>
            <p>This sample is not fully functional. It is scaffolded. Foundation laid. the SD module coded and
                assembled.</p>
            <p>The objective was to build a tool to provide infrastructure for business processes, and adhere to lean
                principles itself. No
                waste. No overengineering.
                Simple in its production version. Reliable. More than adequate to create and maintain a customer
                database. Create
                Sales Orders, help manage and plan production.
                Connect the departments with an intuitive, minimal learning curve to promote adoption. Address many of
                the complaints users post today regarding interfaces, and complexity that does not match the ability of
                the scaled down software.</p>
