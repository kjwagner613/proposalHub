    <h1>Discrete Development LLC</h1>
    <h2>Business Plan</h2>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Purpose</h2>
    <p>Modern work evolves faster than most systems designed to support it. Many organizations operate on tools built for how work used to be done, or how someone wished it would be done. Discrete Development exists to correct that drift.</p>
    <p>By examining a company’s history, processes, and operational reality, we identify where systems have diverged from actual practice. Our purpose is to design solutions that meet today’s requirements while remaining adaptable to tomorrow’s changes.</p>

    <h2>2. Core Values & Philosophy</h2>

    <h3>Philosophy</h3>
    <p>We design systems that respect how work is truly performed. We do not impose rigid templates or force-fit organizations into someone else’s structure. Instead, we build precisely what is needed.</p>

    <h3>Core Values</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Maintain a clear mental image of the desired outcome and continuously evaluate alignment.</li>
      <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Ensure consistency between what is said, documented, and delivered.</li>
      <li><strong>Continuous Growth:</strong> Learn continuously and adopt new methods when they serve the purpose.</li>
      <li><strong>Empathy:</strong> Listen first, understand deeply, and build trust.</li>
      <li><strong>Respect:</strong> Value diverse viewpoints and respond thoughtfully.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Guiding Principles</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Purpose Above All:</strong> Every solution must solve a real need.</li>
      <li><strong>Respect for Original Intent:</strong> Understand the original purpose before extending a system.</li>
      <li><strong>Values as Practice:</strong> These principles define how we operate today.</li>
      <li><strong>Client-Centered Understanding:</strong> Begin without assumptions.</li>
    </ul>
