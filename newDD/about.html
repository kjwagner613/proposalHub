            <p class="category">Discrete Development exists to build software that respects how work is actually done.
            </p>
            <p>Tools should be designed not only for the job they support, but for the people who use them.
                We begin by understanding the work, the operator, and the environment —
                and only then do we build.</p>
            <p>
                Frameworks and templates drift.
                Good systems adapt.
                We design systems that fit people, workflows, and environments as they are —
                and evolve alongside them.
            </p>
            <p class="category">What we believe</p>
            <p>Most inefficiency doesn’t come from lack of effort.
                It comes from tools that don’t reflect reality.
                Processes evolve.
                Workarounds accumulate.
                Knowledge becomes local and tribal.
                Over time, systems drift — not because people are careless, but because work is alive.
                Good software acknowledges this.
            </p>
            <p class="category">How we approach the work</p>
            <p>We begin with observation.</br>
                Before building anything, we take time to understand:</p>
            <ul class="no-bullets">
                <li>how work actually moves</li>
                <li>where friction has become accepted</li>
                <li>what must remain human</li>
                <li>what can quietly disappear through automation</li>
            </ul>
            <p>From there, we design with restraint:</p>
            <ul class="no-bullets">
                <li>clarity over cleverness</li>
                <li>durability over novelty</li>
                <li>simplicity as a feature, not an aesthetic</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The goal is not to impress.</p>
            <p>The goal is to support.</p>
            </p>
